Black Thursday

Black Thursday  was our final project in Module 1 at the Turing School of Software & Design. It is a program that is desined to
take in CSV files - comma seperated value  files - commonly made in xcel and other spreadsheet programs - parse the information
into ruby objects. Relationships are built between the objects with the sales engine acting as the queen-pin taking and passing
information from various repositories which in turn store track indvidual objects. The sales analyst class does the majority of
the meta-data analysis.


Find the [project spec here](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown).
If you wish to see the spec_harness to which it is built clones this repository[spec_harness](https://github.com/vidoseaver/black_thursday_spec_harness)

Note: the spec harness needs to be installed next or in the same directory as the black_thursday directory.
